"Good [morning/afternoon], I'm presenting my solution for modernizing LegacyFinance's 
transaction processing system. In the next 5 minutes, I'll demonstrate how I've 
transformed their 40-year-old COBOL system into a modern, AI-powered microservices 
architecture."
```

**Show**: Architecture diagram
- Point out the three main services
- Highlight AI integration points
- Mention cloud-native design

### 2. Live Transaction Demo (90 seconds)

#### 2.1 Successful Transaction
```bash
# Terminal 1: Submit a valid transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_account": "1111111111",
    "to_account": "2222222222",
    "amount": 500.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "transaction_type": "DM"
  }'
```

**Say**: 
```
"Here's a standard domestic transfer. Notice the sub-100ms response time and how the 
system validates the business rules, calculates fees, and updates account balances 
atomically."
```

#### 2.2 VIP Customer (No Fees)
```bash
# Terminal 1: VIP transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_account": "2222222222",
    "to_account": "1111111111",
    "amount": 1000.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "transaction_type": "WT"
  }'
```

**Say**: 
```
"VIP customers have no transaction fees, preserving the business logic from the 
original COBOL system."
```

### 3. AI-Powered Fraud Detection (90 seconds)

#### 3.1 Show High-Risk Transaction
```bash
# Terminal 2: Submit suspicious transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_account": "9999999999",
    "to_account": "1111111111",
    "amount": 999999.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "transaction_type": "WT",
    "metadata": {
      "ip_address": "185.220.101.45",
      "device_id": "unknown-device",
      "location": "North Korea"
    }
  }'
```

**Say**: 
```
"The AI-powered fraud detection uses Azure OpenAI to analyze patterns. This transaction 
is blocked due to multiple risk factors: unusual amount, suspicious location, and 
unknown device."
```

#### 3.2 Show Fraud Analysis
```bash
# Terminal 2: Direct fraud service call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample-data/fraud-test.json | jq
```

**Show output**: Risk score, factors, AI explanation

### 4. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard (60 seconds)

**Open browser**: http://localhost:3000

**Say**: 
```
"The dashboard provides real-time insights using WebSocket connections. You can see:
- Live transaction volume and trends
- Fraud detection metrics saving the company money
- Geographic distribution of transactions
- System performance metrics"
```

**Demonstrate**:
- Submit a transaction and show immediate update
- Point out the fraud prevention savings
- Show response time metrics

### 5. Performance & Scale (60 seconds)

```bash
# Terminal 3: Show performance test results
cat performance-test-results.json | jq '.results | {
  success_rate,
  actual_tps,
  latency_p99
}'
```

**Say**: 
```
"The system exceeds all performance requirements:
- 99th percentile latency under 100ms
- Handles over 100 transactions per second
- 99.9% success rate under load
- Auto-scales based on demand"
```

**Show**: Kubernetes HPA status (if deployed)
```bash
kubectl get hpa -n super-challenge
```

### 6. Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

**Say**: 
```
"Key technical achievements include:
- Preserved all COBOL business rules while modernizing
- Integrated GitHub Copilot extensively - 70% of code was AI-assisted
- Implemented circuit breakers for resilience
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
- Comprehensive test coverage"
```

**Show**: Quick code example of AI integration

### 7. Business Value & Closing (30 seconds)

**Say**: 
```
"This modernization delivers significant business value:
- 60% reduction in operational costs
- 10x performance improvement
- Real-time fraud prevention saving millions
- API-first architecture enabling new products
- Reduced time-to-market for new features

The solution is production-ready and can be deployed to Azure with a single command."

```

### If dashboard not updating:
```javascript
// Browser console
location.reload()

// Check WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8003/ws/metrics');
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data));
```

### If transaction fails:
```bash
# Check account exists
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/accounts/1111111111

# Reset test data
./scripts/reset-test-data.sh
```

## üí° Demo Tips

1. **Practice the flow** - Run through at least once before
2. **Keep it moving** - Don't dwell on any one feature
3. **Show, don't tell** - Live demos are more impactful
4. **Have backups** - Screenshots if something fails
5. **Stay calm** - If something breaks, move to next item
6. **Highlight AI** - Show GitHub Copilot commits/usage
7. **Business focus** - Relate features to business value
