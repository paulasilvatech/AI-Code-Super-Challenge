## üìù Essential GitHub Copilot Prompts

Use these prompts to accelerate development:

### For Transaction Service
```python
# "Implement transaction validation following COBOL business rules:
#  - Min amount: $0.01, Max: $1,000,000
#  - Daily limit: $5,000,000
#  - VIP customers have no fees
#  - Business accounts can overdraft up to $100,000"

# "Create async function to process transaction atomically with:
#  - Account locking
#  - Balance validation
#  - Fee calculation
#  - Event publishing"

# "Generate comprehensive error handling for all transaction edge cases"
```

### For Fraud Detection
```python
# "Implement multi-layer fraud detection with:
#  - Velocity check: max 50 transactions/hour
#  - Amount anomaly: flag if 300% above average
#  - Geographic check: multiple countries = high risk
#  - Time pattern: 2-5 AM adds risk points"

# "Create Azure OpenAI integration for intelligent fraud analysis using GPT-4"

# "Build self-learning fraud detection that improves from confirmed cases"
```

### For Analytics
```python
# "Create WebSocket endpoint that broadcasts real-time metrics including:
#  - Transaction count and volume
#  - Fraud detection statistics  
#  - Response time percentiles
#  - Geographic distribution"

# "Implement Event Hub consumer for transaction event processing"
```

### For Testing
```python
# "Generate comprehensive integration tests for transaction flow"
# "Create performance test to verify < 100ms p99 latency"
# "Build security tests for SQL injection and authentication"
```

## üî• Speed Development Tips

### 1. Use Provided Starters
Don't write from scratch! The starter code has TODOs:
```python
# src/transaction-service/main.py
@app.post("/api/v1/transactions")
async def process_transaction(transaction: TransactionRequest):
    # TODO: Your implementation here
    # Hint: Use GitHub Copilot to help implement each step
    # Start by typing: "# Step 1: Validate transaction"
```

### 2. Copy Business Logic from COBOL
The COBOL file contains all business rules:
```
legacy-code/TRANSACTION-PROCESSOR.cob
- Lines 50-70: Validation rules
- Lines 100-150: Fee calculations
- Lines 200-250: Fraud checks
```

### 3. Use Docker Compose Services
Everything is pre-configured:
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`
- Redis: `localhost:6379`
- MongoDB: `localhost:27017`
- Kafka: `localhost:9092`

### 4. Leverage AI Heavily
Let GitHub Copilot write:
- Validation functions
- Database queries
- Test cases
- Error handling
- API documentation
- Deployment configs

## üö® Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Problem: Services won't start
```bash
# Quick fix
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
./scripts/test-services.sh
```

### Problem: Database connection errors
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL
docker exec -it superchallenge_postgres_1 psql -U challenge -d transactions

# Reset if needed
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Problem: Fraud service too slow
```python
# Add timeout to fraud check
try:
    fraud_result = await asyncio.wait_for(
        check_fraud_async(transaction),
        timeout=0.5  # 500ms max
    )
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    # Proceed with medium risk
    fraud_result = FraudCheckResponse(risk_score=50)
```

### Problem: Running out of time
Focus on core requirements only:
1. Transaction API must work
2. Basic fraud detection (can be simple rules)
3. Data must persist
4. Dashboard can be minimal
5. Document what's not complete

## üìä Quick Validation Tests

### Test Transaction Processing
```bash
# Valid transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_account": "1111111111",
    "to_account": "2222222222", 
    "amount": 100.00,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'

# Should return in < 100ms with status "completed"
```

### Test Fraud Detection
```bash
# High-risk transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_account": "9999999999",
    "to_account": "1111111111",
    "amount": 999999.00,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'

# Should be blocked with 403 status
```

### Test Analytics
```bash
# Check metrics
curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/metrics/summary

# Test WebSocket (use browser console)
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8003/ws/metrics');
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data));
```
