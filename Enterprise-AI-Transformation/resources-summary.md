## 🚀 How to Use These Resources

### For Instructors

1. **Before the Workshop**
   - Review all documentation
   - Test the setup script in your environment
   - Ensure Azure resources are available
   - Prepare support channels

2. **During Setup**
   - Have participants run the prerequisites check
   - Guide through environment setup
   - Verify everyone can start services
   - Test that VS Code and Copilot work

3. **During Challenge**
   - Monitor support channels
   - Use evaluation guide for scoring
   - Be ready with hints system
   - Track time carefully

4. **After Challenge**
   - Run validation script on submissions
   - Use performance test for verification
   - Complete evaluation rubric
   - Provide feedback

### For Participants

1. **Preparation Phase**
   ```bash
   # 1. Check prerequisites
   ./scripts/validate-prerequisites.sh
   
   # 2. Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/workshop/module-22-super-challenge.git
   cd module-22-super-challenge
   
   # 3. Run setup
   ./scripts/setup-challenge-env.sh
   
   # 4. Configure environment
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with Azure credentials
